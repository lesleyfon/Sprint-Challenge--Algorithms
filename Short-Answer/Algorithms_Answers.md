#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) It is a Logarithmic Time (O(logn)):
This is because after each iteration the value of 'a' increases by (n \* n) plus what ever the previous value of a was. Which is increasing an a faster rate.

b) It is Linearithmic Time (O(nlogn))
This is so because, we are iterating through every count given to us from 0 to n which makes the first for loop iteration a linear runtime and in the second while loop, we are increasing the value of j by the previous value times(\*) 2 which makes the second loops run time to logn, because it is increasing significantly faster.

c) It is a Constant Time (log(c))
This is so because at each recursive call we are reducing the value of bunnies by 1. Increasing the number of bunnies by one will increase the amount of work to be done by one
